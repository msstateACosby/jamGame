# jamGame
A game for the MSU Game Design class game Jam. Theme: Signs.

To use simply clone the project and open the folder with Unity.
TextMeshPro assets and exmples are in the project, because I thought I might use them and it wanted to import them, but they are never used. Should probably remove that.
